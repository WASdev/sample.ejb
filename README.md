Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) Sample
==============


This sample demonstrates injection of an EJB into a servlet. The application consists of a servlet and stateless session bean. The servlet uses annotations to inject the stateless session bean, and then performs a call on the hello method of the bean.

This sample can be installed onto runtime versions 8.5.5.0 and later.


## Running in Eclipse with Maven

## Running with Maven

This project can be built with Apache Maven. The project uses Liberty Maven Plug-in to automatically download and install Liberty with Java EE7 Web Profile runtime from Maven Central. Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

In your browser, enter the URL for the application: [http://localhost:9132/ejbservlet/](http://localhost:9132/ejbservlet/) (where port 9132 assumes the httpEndpoint provided in the sample server.xml has not been modified).
In your browser, you should see the message "Hello EJB World".
